# Introducing Flutter and Getting Started
In this chapter, I learned how to set up Flutter to make apps for mobile, web, and desktop. First, I had to download the Flutter SDK for Windows and unpack it. Next, I chose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), like Visual Studio Code. After installing the IDE, I added Flutter and Dart plugins to help with coding, which made things like highlighting text and fixing errors easier. I also needed to install the Android SDK to create and test Android apps. It's important to use emulators or real devices to check if everything works properly. Finally, I set up Visual Studio Code with Flutter and Dart extensions to make coding even smoother. I ran the flutter doctor command to see if I had everything ready and to fix any missing parts. By doing this, I built a solid base for Flutter development, making it easier for me to continue learning.
